## Abstract
  This is the first solo project of module 3 at Turing School of Software and Design. We were assigned to build a functioning app using React that displays news article summarys and links to the full article. The User is able to filter through specific topics of news on the left hand side of the page. The user may also search for keywords in the article list they clicked, to get instant acces to the individual article they desire
